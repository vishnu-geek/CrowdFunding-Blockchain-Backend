//ADVANCED SOLIDITY
//TO OPTIMES OUR GAS COST
array takes storage in type of hashing
mapping has blank storage
any constant variables an immutable donot take storage the are part of byte code
any constant in function only exist during the function 
variables in function donot take storage as the are deleted once the fumction is executed
string are dynmically size array
every opcode defines some of the bytecode

//CHANGES IN FUNDME.SOLIDITY
we will change all the storage variables by appending _s
and for the address that is immuatble we will append _i
and we will chaneege throughout the contract
in our withdarw function there is for loop which in result
->chcking the condition from funders which is huge gas amount

we will optimise by making it to read from memory instead of reading it from storage
